# Networking and Interworking

## Network issues

- Performance

  - Latency

  - Data transfer rate

    - Data transfer rate = amount of Data / time

    - Message transfer rate time = latency + massage length / data transfer rate 

  - Total system bandwidth of network

    - Throughput (吞吐量) in the end systems
    - Total volume of traffic can be transferred across network in a time

- Scalability
  No designable to cope with size and load about network growing 

- Reliability
  Recoverable from communication failures

- Security
  Protecting network and computers

- Mobility

  - Portability of  computer and handled digital devices using wireless network
  - Location and  identification are depicted with each other
  - No designable to cope with size and load about network growing 

- QoS (Quality of Service)

  Guarantee for requirements of computer and network
  to meet deadline, bandwidth, bounded latency

- Multicasting
  One-to-many communication

## Types of Networks

- LANs (Local Area Networks)
  Technology suitable for small area, wire/fiber

  - High bandwidth 
  - Low latency
  - ATM, better QoS, but more expensive

- WANs (Wide Area Networks)
  Large distances, inter-city/country/continental

  - Low bandwidth, high latency

## Network Principles

### Mode of Transmission

- Packets
  1. Messages divided into packets (on Transport Layer)
  2. Packets **queued in buffers** before sent onto link
  - QoS not guaranteed
- Data streaming

  - Links **guarantee QoS** (rate of delivery)
  - For multimedia traffic
  - Need higher bandwidth

### Switching Schemes

- Broadcasts (Ethernet, wireless)
  - Send messages to all nodes
  - Nodes listen for own messages (carrier sensing)
- Circuit switching (phone networks)
- Packet switching (TCP/IP)
  - Store-and-forward
  - Unpredictable delays
- Frame/Cell relay (ATM) 
  - Bandwidth & latency guaranteed (virtual path)
  - Small, fixed size packets (padded if necessary)
    53 bytes= header 5 + body 48
  - Avoids error checking at nodes (use reliable links)

### Protocols

![1554966735377](assets/1554966735377.png)

- OSI Model

  ![1554966758966](assets/1554966758966.png)

- Message encapsulation

  ![1554966811861](assets/1554966811861.png)

- Internetwork protocol 

  - Internetwork layer(=Virtual network layer)
    internet packet → destination (by datagram protocol)
  - Network interfaces layer
    internetwork packets → suitable packets → underlying layer
  - Underlying network layer

  ![1554967429143](assets/1554967429143.png)

- Port & Addressing

  - Port
    - Network-independent message transport service between networks ports
    - Software-definable destination points for communications

  - Addressing 
    - Delivering messages to destination with transport addresses
    - Transport address
      Network address + port number

- Packet delivery

  - In network layer

    - Datagram packet delivery (IP in Ethernet, most wired and wireless LAN technologies)
    - Virtual circuit packet delivery (ATM)

  - In transport layer

    - Connection-oriented transmission(TCP)
      Reliable communication with static routing table (ISO, X.25)
      Ex) remote login(Telnet), FTP, HTTP(big-sized file), stream data

    - Connectionless transmission (UDP)
      Unreliable communication with pre-defined routing table
      Ex) rcp, rwho, RPC, HTTP(small-sized file), FTP(non-error bulk file)

### Routing

- Necessary in non-broadcast networks (cf Internet) : Hop by Hop
- Distance-vector algorithm for each node
  - Stores table of state & cost information of links, cost infinity for faulty links
  - Determines route taken by packet (the next hop)
  - Periodically updates the table and sends to neighbors
  - May converge slowly [Bellman-Ford]
- RIP-1 (Router Information Protocol) for Internet
  - Local router table changes
  - Use default routes, plus multicast and authentication
  - Better convergence (routes better route to an existing destination)

![1554967857766](assets/1554967857766.png)

- RIP routing algorithm

  Variables: ```Tl``` local table, ```Tr``` remote table received.

  *  ```Rr```: remote, ```Rl``` : local

  Send: Each `t` seconds or when `Tl` changes, send `Tl` on each non-faulty outgoing link.
  Receive: Whenever a routing table `Tr` is received on link `n`:

  ```java
  for all rows Rr in Tr {
  	if (Rr.link != n) {
  		Rr.cost = Rr.cost + 1; // hop
  		Rr.link = n;
  		if (Rr.destination is not in Tl) add Rr to Tl;
   		// add new destination to Tl
   		else for all rows Rl in Tl {
  			if (Rr.destination = Rl.destination and (Rr.cost < Rl.cost or Rl.link = n)) 
  				Rl = Rr;
  			// Rr.cost < Rl.cost : remote node has better route
   			// Rl.link = n : remote node is more authoritative
  		}
  	}
  }
  ```

### Congestion Control

- When load on network exceeds 80%  of its capacity
  packet queues long, links blocked
- Solutions (in datagram-based network layers)
  - packet dropping
    reliable of delivery at higher levels
  - reduce rate of transmission
    - nodes send choke packets (Ethernet)
      special message requesting a reduction in transmission rate
    - transmission control (TCP)
  - transmit congestion information to each node
    QoS guarantees (ATM)

###  Transport level protocols

![1554971496396](assets/1554971496396.png)

### IP(TCP/IP) Addressing

- IP Structure(Universal)(IPv4 : 4bytes = 32bits)

  ![1554971635624](assets/1554971635624.png)

- IP Packet layout

  ![1554971656352](assets/1554971656352.png)

### IPv6

![1554971724596](assets/1554971724596.png)

- Large Address Space - 128 bit addresses
  Every toaster can have its own IP address
- Aggregation-based address hierarchy
  Efficient backbone routing
- Efficient and Extensible IP datagram
  - No fragmentation by routers
  - 64 bits field alignment
  - Simpler basic header
- Auto-configuration
- Security
- IP Renumbering part of the protocol

![1554971962299](assets/1554971962299.png)

- TLA – top level aggregator
  Primary providers 
- NLA: Next Level Aggregator
  Can have multiple NLA as sub-NLA
- SLA: Site Level Aggregator
  Your site (16 bits)
- Addresses are allocated from your provider
  If you change provider, your prefix changes
  But renumbering (of hosts, routers and sites) has been included in the IPv6 protocol

- IPv6 Header layout (16bytes: 128bits)

  ![1554972312467](assets/1554972312467.png)

- IPv6’s main advances (Adapted by IETF in 1994)
  - Address space (2128 = 3×1038 IPs), routing speed up 
  - Real-time and other special services
  - Future evolution
  - Multicating & anycasting
  - Security

### MobileIP

- At home normal, when elsewhere mobile host:
  notifies HA(Home Agent) before leaving
  informs FA(Foreign Agent), who allocates temporary care-of IP address & tells HA
- Packets for mobile host (MH):
  first packet routed to HA, encapsulated in MobileIP packet and sent to FA (tunneling)
  FA unpacks MobileIP packet and sends to mobile host
  sender notified of the care-of address for future communications which can be direct via FA
- Problems
  efficiency low, need to notify HA

![1554972533058](assets/1554972533058.png)

### Wireless LAN: IEEE 802.11
- Radio broadcast (fading strength, obstruction)
- Collision avoidance by
  Slot reservation mechanism by Request to Send (RTS) and Clear to Send (CTS)
  Stations in range pick up RTS/CTS and avoid transmission at the reserved times
  Collisions less likely than Ethernet, since RTS/CTS short
  Random back off period
- Problems
  Security (eaves dropping), use shared-key authentication

![1554973056788](assets/1554973056788.png)

### Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM)
- Multimedia data(voice and video), distributed system services are available
- Packet switching network based on Cell-relay (a method of packet routing)
- Avoiding flow-control and error checking at the intermediate nodes
- Small and fixed length unit of data transmitted (53bytes= header 5 + body 48)
  reduction of buffer size, complexity, queuing delay at intermediate nodes
- B-ISDN (CCITT I.150 standard)
- Optical fiber transmission medium (155 - 622 megabits/sec)
- ATM protocol  layers (next page)
